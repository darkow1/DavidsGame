Game:

A character runs vertically on the screen. The screen moves vertically constantly, and the user only controls the horizontal movement of the character. There are tokens scattered across the screen that appear in random places and the user can move the character horizontally to collect the coins. However, there are obstacles on the screen including hurdles which the user must jump over and bridges which the user must slide under. If the user hits either of the obstacles, they lose one of their three lives and restart that level. To complete the first level, the user must collect 5 tokens in under one minute without losing all their lives. Each time the user levels up, they must collect one additional token and the speed at which the screen moves increases. For experimental features, there are special icons on the screen including a heart (gain a life), banana peels (lose control for 5 seconds), and a diamond (immunity from obstacles for 10 seconds). There is a display of the users total tokens, level tokens, time remaining at that level, and lives remaining at the top corner of the screen. For multiplayer, there is a split screen and they use separate keyboard controls (WASD) to navigate their characters. Whoever survives longer and collects more tokens wins.

Objectives: Collect Tokens within Time Limit and Stay Alive
