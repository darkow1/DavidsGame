Create an object (like a pac man) that moves up and down the screen collecting buckets of gold. There should be pots of gold (squares) on different parts of the screen that appear randomly. Once a bucket is collected (touched by the object), add to the overall gold bucket count. Keep an overall bucket tally at the top of the screen. Press q to quit.
